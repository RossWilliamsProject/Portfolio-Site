This project is this website! I designed and developed the entire thing from scratch - from the very first UI design on figma, to the CSS you're looking at now. The site is written in react and associated react libraries (such as react animation, navigation and router dom), with heavy use of CSS. The site is hosted using Google firebase, a site and API that I was familiar with from previous use. Most of the site works using "conditional rendering" - which works by detecting the width of the screen that the site is open on and then adjusting the CSS to fit. For example, the mobile site uses a hamburger button instead of a navigation bar.

The most difficult part of this project was ensuring the design was "interesting" - but projects and the skills needed for each one are still easy to understand at a glance. I did this using a "card" based system that have a high glance value - composed of react components that are filled based on a data file (so new projects can be added easily).
